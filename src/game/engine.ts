/* ArchMage engine — canvas simulation: waves, spells, resonances, boss, arena.
   Patch 7.0 "The Pure Arcanum": the story layer is fully excised — no
   cutscene phase, no NPC dialogue, no boss taunts/death lines. Boss clears
   roll straight into evolution offers; victory fires directly. New
   intelligent systems from the roguelike research: bestiary discovery
   callbacks (first-kill per enemy type / boss), elite HP bars, a damage-
   numbers setting, boss phase-2 enrage bursts, an act threat meter in the
   HUD payload, and ADAPTIVE MUSIC INTENSITY (menu / combat / boss) plus
   pause ducking through the shared Sfx instance. All prior cadences are
   unchanged: 3 starting spells, scheduled drops every 3-5 waves (strict),
   merges every 10 waves, tribute gates every 5 waves, five seed-shuffled
   bosses, DIFFICULTY_MULT 0.9.
   Patch 9.0 "The Expanded Rift": the arena became a FIXED 1920×1280 WORLD
   explored through a smooth follow-camera with device-tailored FOV zoom
   (phones/tablets see wider for maximum readability), a flow-field
   pathfinder + LOS raycasts so ground enemies path AROUND pillars instead
   of jamming against them, ring spawns around the player, five new enemy
   behaviors (skitter/bomber/lancer/warden/mender), two new spells (wind,
   sonic), a per-death Rift Mercy ladder with concrete attack/defense/spawn
   effects, a hold-to-fire FIRE button with auto-targeting, and Archmage
   Mode improvements (pillar avoidance, boss-volley dodging, desktop access).
   Patch 10.2 "The Thinking Rift": every tyrant now runs a UNIQUE behavior
   set (stampede charges, slam shockwaves + adds, blade-dance lunges, blink
   spirals, and an apex storm mixing all three) with per-boss enrages, all
   boss spawn cutscenes/title cards/message banners are GONE (pure audio +
   visual telegraphs), the Fateweaver (Archmage Mode's brain) casts with
   line-of-sight discipline — resonance-aware, mana-economical, never firing
   at foes behind walls — and picks boons from live run context, the flow
   field can't be corner-cut or stuck (no-corner-cut descent, faster stuck
   recovery, rift-hop failsafe), the world grows to 2560×1600 with eight
   archetypes, and the Rift Seed drives a per-seed enemy ecology (poolBias).
   Optimized replica: dead-flag entities + in-place compaction (zero per-frame
   array allocation), squared-distance hot paths, cached gradients, seeded
   reward drafts, head-indexed spawn queue, throttled preallocated HUD payload. */

     A full self-playing brain that runs once per frame while enabled:
       • steering  — kites at a preferred range, orbits/strafes, repels from
                     enemies / incoming bolts / hazards, attracts to drops,
                     shrines and fountains, avoids walls
       • targeting  — picks the juiciest enemy (boss > ranged > melee,
                     distance-weighted) and leads its velocity for aim
       • casting    — scores every equipped slot per situation and fires the
                     best (crowds favour chains/AoE, lone tough foes favour
                     lances/beams, pressure favours blink/pillar escapes)
       • weaving    — free arcane bolts to charge the Weave meter, then pops
                     Weave Surge the instant it fills
       • dodging    — blink-steps out of point-blank danger bolts / swarms
     Human input always wins: touching a stick pauses the pilot for 0.8s.

     Patch 10.2 — BOSS BRAINS. The single shared charge/volley loop is gone:
     every tyrant is now a fully distinct encounter.
       vorrac   — Stampede Charger: stalks, then chains 2–3 re-aimed charges
                  with a short windup between each; aimed fan volleys.
       korrath  — Immovable Juggernaut: never charges, never strafes — walks
                  you down, slams expanding shockwave rings, sheds cinder imps.
       solenne  — Blade Dancer: orbits at fencing range on a metronome tempo
                  (3-bolt fans that accelerate as she bleeds), then chains
                  lunges THROUGH the mage.
       ysed     — Blink Fortress: anchors and channels rotating twin-arm
                  spiral barrages, then blinks to a fresh anchor around the
                  mage with a landing pulse. Massive soak, positioning puzzle.
       maelthar — The Apex Storm: cycles all three signatures — stampede
                  charges, a multi-arm spiral, and a gravity rift that drags
                  the mage in before the nova release.
     Shared conventions:
       • actState 2 is ALWAYS a dashing/charging state, so the shared
         contact-damage ×1.45 rule keeps working unchanged.
       • subT doubles as a sub-timer/flag, count as a repeat/phase counter,
         armAng as the spiral arm angle, wob as Korrath's shockwave radius.
       • Enrage (below half HP) never just speeds old attacks up — each
         pattern densifies or adds (Dead Cells rule).
