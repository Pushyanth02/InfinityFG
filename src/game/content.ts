/* Static game content: seeded RNG, spells, combinations, enemies, scaling, arena generation.
   Patch 7.0 "The Pure Arcanum": the story layer is GONE — no cutscenes, no
   NPC dialogue, no art beyond the cover. Acts remain as biome definitions
   (canvas palettes + music roots), bosses keep their identities as pure
   mechanical encounters, and the meta save gains bestiary discovery
   tracking (seenEnemies / seenBosses). Settings lose the cutscenes toggle
   and gain a damage-numbers toggle. All prior cadences are unchanged:
   3 starting spells, drops every 3-5 waves, merges every 10 waves, tribute
   gates every 5 waves, five shuffled bosses.
   Patch 9.0 "The Expanded Rift": +2 elements (wind, sonic → 13 spells,
   78 resonances), +5 normal enemy types (19 total), Rift Mercy reworked to
   a per-death assist ladder with a selectable tier, the global −10%
   difficulty now ALSO covers spawn pressure, and the arena became a fixed
   1920×1280 world with five seed-driven layout archetypes.
   Patch 10.2 "The Thinking Rift": the world grows to 2560×1600 with EIGHT
   layout archetypes (three new floor plans), and the Rift Seed now also
   drives an enemy ECOLOGY — poolBias() bends every foe type's spawn weight
   per seed (two "featured" stars surge, some fade), so altering the seed
   reshapes both the map AND the monster pool.
   Patch 11.0 "The Umbral Requiem": full dark-arcane REBRAND — every spell,
   tyrant, foe and act is renamed into the black-grimoire register (ids stay
   stable so saves keep working), and the DROP ECONOMY becomes STRICT: each
   wave fields exactly ONE drop type (spell / heart / resonance / tribute),
   spell orbs no longer heal (hearts are their own drop), and resonance orbs
   demand a sacrifice — two bound spells fused into one. */
